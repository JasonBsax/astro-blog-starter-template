What I hope to accomplish professionally in the next couple of decades is to perform music at the highest level I possibly can. My greatest ambition is to remain a working musician throughout my life and to continue developing my craft as a saxophonist. Music is not just a career path for me. It is something I’m passionate about, and I intend to honor that as fully as I am able.

In terms of specific goals, I would love to perform in a big band setting, where I can be part of that rich, layered sound that only a large ensemble can create. At the same time, I want to be active in a small group context, where there is more room for individual expression and spontaneity. Eventually, I would also like to lead my own band, creating my own sound and bringing my own musical vision to life.

That said, I am realistic about the challenges that come with pursuing a life in music. Because I live with a chronic illness, having reliable access to medical insurance is a necessity. For that reason, I anticipate spending the first decade or so of my professional life in a more stable position, such as an office job, that can provide the benefits I need. It is a practical compromise, but not a surrender to my true passion for the saxophone.

Ultimately, I want to die as a musician, not as a white-collar worker. I do not want to look back on my life and feel that I let fear or circumstance pull me away from what matters to me. Starting a business is not something I see in my future, as entrepreneurship simply does not inspire me. Of course, the future is always uncertain, but my intention stays the same. 

This is a widely optimistic sight for the future. Who knows, I could get in a car crash and injure myself, or be paralyzed from the waist down, or end up as futerlizer in some random field. You never know
