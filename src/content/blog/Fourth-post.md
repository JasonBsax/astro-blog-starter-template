What I hope to accomplish professionally in the next couple of decades is to perform music. I would like to stay as a musician, hopefully, and continue my work as a saxophonist. I would also like to be performing in a big band, along with a small group. I might also like to lead my own band. For the first decade, I would have a more stable job, like an office job, because I have a chronic Illness and need medical insurance. But ultimately, I want to die as a musician, not a white-collar worker. I probably won’t start up a business because it is something I am not interested in, but the future is uncertain.
