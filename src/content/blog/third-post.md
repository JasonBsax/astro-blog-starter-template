I wouldn't actively set out to start a business—it's just not something that interests me. However, I do hope to lead a band one day, which, in some ways, is similar to launching a startup. The idea is always in the back of my mind, though for now, as you mentioned, I've "shelved it." As for actually building a startup, that's not something I've pursued or plan to pursue in the future. Still, you never know—life can surprise you sometimes.
